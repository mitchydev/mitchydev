## About Me
ðŸ“š I am studying at Grinnell College studying Computer Science and Economics with a concentration in Film & Media Studies.
ðŸ¤¿ When I am not studying or hanging out with friends, I am probably swimming.
ðŸŽ¢ I love all things rollercoasters, from the steel that constructs them to the code that allows them to run safely.
